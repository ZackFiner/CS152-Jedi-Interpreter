# CS152-Jedi-Interpreter
This project was created for CS152 (Programming paradigms) and constituted the bulk of the course work in the latter half of the semester.

Jedi is an experimental functional language which features short circuit evaluation, lambda functions, and lazy evaluation as well as
various other features. 

The project was to create an interpreter for the Jedi language. Students were given starter code and a set of UML diagrams which described the overall structure of the interpreter, and were asked to use Scala's built in parsing library as well as the material they had learned over the course of the semester to implement the interpreter.

This project requires the use of scala-parser-combinators_2.12-1.0.5.jar file.

This project was NOT UPLOADED SO OTHER STUDENTS COULD CHEAT ON THEIR PROJECT. If you are currently enrolled in CS152 and are supposed
to implement this project, please refrain from submitting files and code used in this repository:
You will not learn anything by copying code you don't understand, you put yourself at risk of receiving severe disciplinary action if you're caught (which isn’t all that unlikely, as the professor will likely know about this repository), and you’re only delaying the inevitable.
